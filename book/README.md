# Introduction

The Cybera Data Science team dedicated a 2 week sprint to look into contributing to the [Datathon with the Calgary Foundation hosted by Data for Good â€“ Calgary](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/datathon-with-the-calgary-foundation-hosted-by-data-for-good-calgary-tickets-38870832707) in advance of the actual datathon. This was made possible by getting early access to the data for the datathon :)

We decided to focus our efforts on the Team 4 Challenge of Text and Network Analytics and specifically Question 4E `Are there trends or similarities in the way charities describe themselves? Do these serve to predict the size of an organization or its likelihood to get funded?`.
